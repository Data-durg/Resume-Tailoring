# Resume-Tailoring
 Resume tailoring A company has a requirement for diffrent job roles And your manager wants you to do some basic analysis for him. For most job openings, a particular skill set is desired to perform specific tasks. Tailoring your resume is about recognizing those skills and responsibilities on the job description and making it obvious that you’re up to the task. Your company's goal is to draw the shortest line possible between your experience and what’s stated in the job description. Tailoring your resume connects the dots for recruiters and hiring managers who are overwhelmed by a flood of generic applicants. Instead of proving that you’re an experienced professional in general, it shows them that you’re a perfect fit for this specific job.
